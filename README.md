# Amazon_Sales

1. Problem Statement:
Amazon’s sales data is vast and complex, making it challenging to derive actionable insights. The lack of a centralized visualization system hinders decision-making. Key challenges include:
•	Tracking sales performance across years, regions, markets, and customer segments. 
•	Analyzing production units, quantities, and return rates. 
•	Measuring profitability by customer and segment. 
•	Managing data integration, refresh, and access control.
